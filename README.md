Reality Fragments
A surreal, on-chain mosaic of reality — built one fragment at a time.

Reality Fragments is a Web3 application where users upload images, and each image is automatically sliced into abstract “reality fragments”.
Each fragment becomes a unique NFT and is added to a collective, ever-evolving Reality Wall—an on-chain mosaic built by the community.

This project blends art, abstraction, and decentralized ownership into a single visual experience.

🌐 Features
🖼️ Fragmented Image Minting

Users upload an image

App slices it into multiple abstract pieces

Each piece becomes a mintable NFT fragment

🧩 The Reality Wall

A dynamic, scrollable digital mosaic

All fragments from all users displayed in one collective space

Interactive zoom + hover animations

Clicking a fragment opens its NFT page

👤 Personal Fragment Collections

Users can view all fragments they own

Clean grid layout with glassmorphism styling

🌌 Fragment Map

Shows how fragments from one image relate to each other

Abstract lines connect sibling fragments

Feels like a digital constellation

⛓️ On-Chain Ownership

All fragments are ERC-721 tokens

Metadata includes: origin image hash, slice index, creation timestamp, owner, and rarity coloring

🎨 Design Philosophy

Reality Fragments aims to feel like:
“a dream museum inside a broken camera.”

Key aesthetics:

Soft glitch effects

Chromatic edges + neon glows

Glass panels and floating shards

Slow breathing animations

Surreal, ambient UI

The entire interface is meant to look alive — shifting, pulsing gently, and constantly evolving as new fragments appear.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend:

Next.js / React

Framer Motion for interactions and animations

TailwindCSS (glassmorphism, neon styles)

Smart Contracts:

Hardhat or Foundry

IPFS for storage

Backend / Services:

Node.js

Pinata / Web3.Storage for image + metadata uploads

🚀 How It Works

Upload Image
User drags an image into the Upload Portal.

Fragment Slicing
A custom function slices the image into multiple abstract shards.

Minting
Each shard becomes its own NFT with unique metadata.

Reality Wall Update
After minting, fragments appear on the global mosaic in real time.

Users Explore
Navigate the wall, zoom into shards, and collect fragments.

🔮 Future Enhancements

Fragment Trading (marketplace)

🧩 Vision

Reality Fragments isn’t just an app — it’s a collective digital artwork.

Every user contributes their reality.
Every fragment becomes part of a global mosaic.
And together, the blockchain stores a surreal, eternal reflection of human experience.
